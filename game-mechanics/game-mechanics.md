# Game Mechanics

Robin Hunicke, Mark Leblanc, and Robert Zubek who authored the MDA framework for games defined **Game Mechanics** as the components of the game, at the level of data representation and algorithms. (_ie. The Rules for the game_).&#x20;

Game designers Tracy Fullerton and Chris Swain broke game mechanics into individual game elements without which a game can not exist. These elements are referred to as the **Formal Elements**.

## Formal Elements&#x20;

According to game designers Tracy Fullerton and Chris Swain, game mechanics can be broken down into individual game elements, referred to as the **formal elements** of games. These elements include:

* **Objectives or Goals** – what the player must strive to accomplish
* **Rules** – what the player can and cannot do
* **Procedures** – steps to playing the game
* **Players** – individuals playing the game
* **Resources** – game assets that aid the player
* **Conflict** – the obstacles that the player encounters
* **Boundaries** – the limitations to what the player can do
* **Outcomes** – a winner, looser or draw

If we consider the differences between a game and play we can clearly see how the elements listed above are essential to a game.&#x20;

### Objective or Goal

Play is just for the sake of amusement, but a defining factor of a game is that it has an **objective** or **goal**. For simplicity let's refer to these both as the objective and the objective of a game is defined as what the players are trying to accomplish. Furthermore, player involvement can be measured by their motivation to work towards the game goal.&#x20;

When designing a game, game designers often start by defining the game's objective. What is it that the player has to do in order to win or progress?&#x20;

Let's take the game of Soccer, the objective is to take the ball over the goal line into the goal net.&#x20;

When designing a game it is a good idea to start with one main objective; as the game is further developed sub-objectives can be incorporated into the game. **Sub-objectives** can enhance games by providing short term or optional challenges for your players to take up. The dynamics of the game could also lead to **player-defined objectives**.

<summary>ACTIVITY: Go Fish </summary>

#### Activity Time: 30 Minutes

## Learning Objective <a href="#_m5i477crav6g" id="_m5i477crav6g"></a>

This activity is designed to help students identify what rules are necessary to a game's game mechanics, what rules entice gameplay, and what rules are non-essential in game development.

### **Collaborative Learning Methods**

#### **Traditional Course**

Students are to complete this activity as a group. Group size should be between 3 and 4 individuals. Each member of the group should participate and display a positive attitude.

#### **Online Course**

Students are to complete step 1 of the activity on their own, finding another student, friend, or family member to play through the activity. After completing they should post their responses to the questions in the discussion forum.

### Overview

Go Fish is a card game using a basic 52 deck of playing cards. The invention of the game is credited to an 8-year-old boy from New York in 1984, however, some evidence shows that a variation of the game has been played over a hundred years ago in China.

While you may have played the game as a child, have you ever really thought about what makes this game work? What procedures, objectives of format are required to make a game playable?. If the procedures (steps) and or rules were different would the game still be playable? Would it still be Go Fish?

&#x20;

### **Direction**

1. Play a round of go fish using the rules on the next page.
   1. Play the game a few rounds; thinking about how the rules of the game make an impact.
2. Play Go Fish a second time, this time taking out one of the rules, then answer the following questions:
   1. What rule did you take out?
   2. Can the game still be played or is it essential to the game?
   3. How did the game change without this rule?
3. Play Go Fish one last time, this time adding a new rule(s) to the game, then answer the following questions:
   1. What was the new rule(s) you added?&#x20;
   2. &#x20;How did the new rule(s) change the game? &#x20;
4. Discuss and Reflect on your peer's answers
   1. Were there any similarities?&#x20;
   2. Did someone think of something you never thought about?

## GO FISH&#x20;

#### **PLAYERS**

2 to 6 players, best with 3 to 6.

#### **RESOURCES (DECK)**

Standard 52-card deck.

#### **GOAL**

To collect the most sets of four.

#### **SETUP**

Five cards are dealt to each player if three to six players are involved. With only two players, seven cards are dealt to each.

All remaining cards are placed face down in a draw pile.

#### **GAMEPLAY**

Randomly choose a player to go first.

On your turn, ask a player for a specific card rank. For example: "Barb, please give me your 9s." You must already hold at least one card of the requested rank.

If the player you ask has any cards of the requested rank, she must give all of her cards of that rank to you. In the example, Barb would have to give you all of her 9s.

If you get one or more cards from the player you ask, you get another turn. You may ask any player for any rank you already hold, including the same one you just asked for.

If the person you ask has no relevant cards, they say, "Go fish." You then draw the top card from the pile.

If you happen to draw a card of the rank asked for, show it to the other players and you get another turn.

However, if you draw a card that's not the rank you asked for, it becomes the next player's turn. You keep the drawn card, whatever rank it is.

NOTE:  The "next player" is the one who said, "Go fish."

When you collect a set of four cards of the same rank, immediately show the set to the other players and place the four cards face down in front of yourself.

#### **WINNING**

Go Fish continues until either someone has no cards left in their hand or the draw pile runs out. The winner is the player who then has the most sets of four.

### Rules and Procedures

Once the objective of the game is defined the next step is to develop the rules and procedures.&#x20;

The **rules** are the instructions that dictate how the player can achieve their goal. Specifically what action one can and can not do in the game.

**Rules must clearly define:**

* the objective of the game
* what actions are allowed and not allowed
* the effects of certain actions.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Not every rule is critical to a game**. Avoid adding rules that are non-essential or overly complex.
{% endhint %}

Going back to the example of soccer, the rules state that all players except for the goalkeeper can not pick up the ball with their hands, instead the ball can only be kicked forward toward the goal.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The limiting actions defined by the rules create a sense of **challenge**, which is an element of **gameplay**, which we will discuss further in later sections.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Procedures** are the actions or methods allowed by the rules. If the rules state what actions one can and can not do, the **procedures tell you who, what, where, when and how** those actions take place.&#x20;

Going back to our soccer example the procedures for playing state:

1. &#x20;Game starts with a kickoff, determined by a coin toss
2. &#x20;From the center of the field, the kickoff team will kick the ball
3. &#x20;The first player to kick the ball must pass to another to start the game

{% hint style="info" %}
Aside from game procedures, there might also be **system procedures**, which are used to calculate and randomize aspects of the game. In physical games, these procedures can be controlled by dice or cards while in digital games these conditions are programmed into loops.
{% endhint %}

When designing a game the rules and procedures go hand and hand. Sometimes the order of a rule is just as important as the rule itself. Only through playtesting can designers assess the rules and procedures of a game and how they impact the gameplay dynamics.&#x20;

### Overview

Since around 1300 BCE there has been evidence of games played on a three-in-row board. The first printed reference of such a game was in 1858 describing the British named game “noughts and crosses”. Some thirty years later in 1884 the widely known children’s game “Tic-Tac-Toe” made its first documented appearance.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game in which players must match 3-in-a-row. Players are an integral part of any game, the number, role, and interaction patterns of the players all change the game mechanics.

### **Direction**

1. Play a round of tic-tac-toe using the rules (see page 3). Or play online at ([https://www.google.com/search?q=tic+tac+toe](https://www.google.com/search?q=tic+tac+toe) )
   1. Play the game; thinking about the number of players affects the game
2. Play a new round of tic-tac-toe, this time redesigning the game for 3 or more players
3. Play your new version of the game. Answer the following questions:
   1. &#x20;What changes did you need to make?
   2. Are the boundaries of the game different?
   3. How well did the redesign work?
4. Discuss and Reflect on your peer's answers
   1. Were there any similarities?&#x20;
   2. Did someone think of something you never thought about?

</details>

### Players

Remember that the game design must be an **advocate for the player**, and as such the first consideration in designing any game is to define who that player is.&#x20;

As the rules and procedures begin to take shape it is also important to identify the number of players and how those players will interact with the game and each other.

<figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1494778696781-8f23fd5553c4?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MnwxOTcwMjR8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw3fHxwbGF5ZXJzfGVufDB8fHx8MTY3NTAyNzU0NA&#x26;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&#x26;q=80" alt=""><figcaption><p>Players of a soccer game</p></figcaption></figure>

In the game of soccer, there are 11 players on each team and two opposing teams. Each team has a designated goalkeeper.&#x20;

Have you ever wondered why there are 11 players per team for a soccer game but only nine players per team for a basketball game? How did these numbers come about?&#x20;

When designing a game, not only does the **number of players** impact the game but so does **each player's role** in the game. Game designers need to be aware of these player dynamics and how they can affect the game.

In addition, there should be an **invitation to play** the game, in other words, why should the play want to play this game? This goes back to the objective of the game, is the objective motivating enough to the player?&#x20;

Earlier we discussed the **magic circle**, the fictional reality in which players buy into the rules of the game. Players have to voluntarily accept the rules to enter the magic circle. Defining clear and concise rules help the player accept the game's reality, while poorly developed rules will leave the player guessing and ultimately break the magic circle.&#x20;

#### Player Interaction Patterns

Not only is the number of players and their roles important but how the players interact with each other is equally important. How different would soccer be if there were no teams and all players were competing agist each other, or simply against a single goalkeeper? Would it be the same game?&#x20;

&#x20;The most common player interaction patterns include:&#x20;

* **Single Player**– player competes against the game system
* **Multi-Individual** – multiple players compete against the game in the company of others
* **Player vs Player** – two players directly competing.
* **Unilateral Competition** – two or more players compete against one
* **Multilateral Competition** – 3 or more players directly compete
* **Cooperative Play** – players work together against the game
* **Team Competition** – two or more groups compete against each other

### Resources

**Resources** are game assets that aid in the player reaching their objective. Resources must have both **utility** and **scarcity**.

<figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1629760946220-5693ee4c46ac?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MnwxOTcwMjR8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwzfHxib2FyZCUyMGdhbWV8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjc1MDI5MDcw&#x26;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&#x26;q=80" alt=""><figcaption><p>Game resources can be units on a board</p></figcaption></figure>

Some common types of game resources include:&#x20;

* Lives&#x20;
* Units&#x20;
* Health&#x20;
* Currency&#x20;
* Actions&#x20;
* Power Ups&#x20;
* Inventory&#x20;
* Special Terrain&#x20;
* Time

The rules and procedures of a game should define when and how the player can use the resources in the game.&#x20;

### Conflict

**Conflict** is the opposing force which the player works to overcome in order to achieve their objectives.&#x20;

Conflict is built into the game through the rules and procedures. Some classic sources of conflict come from:&#x20;

* **Obstacles:** physical or mental barriers that the player must overcome.
* **Opponents:** other players are the most common type of opponent in any multiplayer game.&#x20;
* **Dilemmas:** a difficult choice that the player must make.

Conflict is not to be confused with **challenge**. To differentiate the two let us define them as follows:&#x20;

* **Conflict** - to be at odds with someone or something.
* **Challenge** - to arouse or stimulate, especially by presenting with difficulties/conflict.

Given the definitions above we can make the connection that conflict creates a challenge. In the game of soccer conflict is defined by the boundary of the playing field (obstacle) the other opponents on the other team and the dilemma of which teammate on your team to pass the ball to.   The challenge is to develop skills that will allow oneself to overcome these conflicts with speed and precision.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
While **challenge** relates to conflict, it is not an element of game mechanics but instead an element of **gameplay**, which will be discussed further in later sections.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Boundary

**Boundaries** are the limiting factors that only apply within the game world (magic circle) and not the “real world”.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/pexels-mike-1171084.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>The soccer field defines the boundary of the game</p></figcaption></figure>

Boundaries can be physical – like the edge of an arena, playing field, or game board. In digital games, boundaries are more conceptual than physical.

It is also important to note that some games do not require strictly defined boundaries to work

### Outcome

**Outcome** is the result at the end of the game. **Outcomes must be uncertain** and should be resolved in a measurable and unequal outcome.

**Balance** is an important aspect of outcomes because balance refers to the **perception** that the game is **consistent, fair, and fun**. Also note that we say perception, after all many carnival-style games are totally rigged, but there is a certain perception that we might win, which keeps the player playing.

## Defining Game Mechanics

To summarize **game mechanics** can be defined as the construct of all formal game elements, predominantly the **rules** and **procedures**, intended to produce enjoyable **gameplay**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Gameplay** consists of all **player experiences** primarily the **challenges**, **choices**, and **consequences** that the player faces within the game.
{% endhint %}

Game mechanics are the most important aspect of game development because without these elements the game would not function and be ultimately unplayable.

Once a basic set of game mechanics are developed the game design team will playtest the game by making a physical prototype to ensure that the game mechanics are solid before proceeding to the next stage of development. &#x20;
