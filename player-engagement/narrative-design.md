# Narrative Design

Just like games, stories have been around throughout the history of humankind. Telling stories is a way to help us make sense of the world, and in some cases make sense of a game. While not all games inherently have a story, a story often emerges from a game.&#x20;

The card game WAR for example, just by it's name creates a narrative of two empires battling for supremacy. Games of sports, often have a narrative created by the commentary, which highlights the highs and lows of the game, by creating a narrative that makes us emphasize with the characters; who are in this case the players themselves.&#x20;

Whether the story emerges through play or is embedded into the game itself, narratives can help to develop player engagement.&#x20;

## Elements of Narrative Design

**Plot** is the foundation that holds the story together.

**Theme** is the primariy obstacle and setting. According to George fan creator of Plants vs. Zombies, themes should have familiarty and novelty.&#x20;
