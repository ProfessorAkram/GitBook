# Visual Design

**Visual design** is defined as the use of imagery, color, shapes, typography, and form to enhance usability and improve the **user experience**. Visual design is applied can apply to any field, from architecture, product design, graphic design, web design, physical game design, and even video game design. All of the elements used within visual design are known as the **Elements of Design** sometimes referred to as the **Elements of Art**.

## Elements Of Design

### Dot or Point

All designs begin with a single **point**. Two or more points will immediately translate into a **line**. This imaginary line is created by the brain as it is wired to see order and relationship, thereby grouping like items and literally connecting the dots.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
A form of psychology, originating in Germany during the 1920's, **Gestalt Theory** suggests that the human brain does not focus on the small components of the world around them, but perceives objects as elements of a larger system. The term gestalt can be defined as a "unified whole" referring to visual perception.&#x20;

To explain how Gestalt perception works a series of principles were established. Some of the most common principles are:

* **Pr√§gnanz** - The perception of things in their simplest form or organization
* **Similarity** - Grouping similar items together based on other elements
* **Proximity** - Objects near each other tend to be viewed as a group
* **Continuity** - Elements arranged on a line or curved are related, our eyes move with these elements
* **Closure** - The perception of a closed form (shape); creating closure to make sense of an object.&#x20;

### **Line**

**Lines** are made up of multiple points, essentially our eyes following the path of the points. Lines can also be defined as a linear mark that moves through space.&#x20;

### Shape & Form&#x20;

A **Shape** is formed by enclosed lines and is **two-dimensional**. Shapes that are **three-dimensional** and have depth are referred to as **form**.&#x20;

### Space

The area that surrounds the design is referred to as **space**. Space can be positive, the area of interest, or negative the white/empty space. The element of space can provide enhanced readability, simplification of design, closure as described by the Gestalt theory, and a sense of sophistication, as less is more.&#x20;

### Texture

**Texture** is the surface quality of a shape, the physical feel of the surface or the perception of the feel of the surface.&#x20;

### Color

**Color** is by far the most impactful of all elements and invokes the greatest emotional power of any design. Color is made up of three components, **hue** is the pure color, the name of the color, **value** which is the relative lightness and darkness of a color, and **saturation,** a scale from fully intense to low intensity.

The art and science of color is called **Color Theory**. Color Theory is used to explain how we perceive color, the relationship between colors, and the message which color communicates.&#x20;

### Value

The relative lightness and darkness of a surface is its **value**. Relative is a keyword when speaking about value, as a grey square on a white background will appear stable and imposing, while the same grey square on a black background will appear brighter when surrounded by black.&#x20;

Using a full range of values can create the illusion of **volume,** thereby making a two-dimensional shape appear three-dimensional.&#x20;

### Type

For the literal interpretation of a design, **type** is an important element. Furthermore, type when used intentionally can establish a relationship between the content and the visuals.

## Principles of Design&#x20;

While all designs are made up of the elements of design there are **Principles of Design** that provide guidelines for using the elements to ensure an effective design.&#x20;
