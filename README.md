# What is a Game

<details>

<summary>ACTIVITY: Define Game</summary>

**Activity Time: 10 Minutes**

## Learning Objective <a href="#_m5i477crav6g" id="_m5i477crav6g"></a>

This activity is designed to help students identify the words and emotions most commonly associated with the term “Game. After completing this activity students will have a larger sense of what the term represents to others.

### **Collaborative Learning Methods**

#### **Traditional Course**

Students are to work in groups of 2 to 4 to complete step 1 and then share their list with the rest of the class. Through group discussion, students will complete step 2.

#### **Online Course**

Students will complete step 1 individually by posting in a discussion form. Students will reply to 3 or more posts by their peer to complete step 2.&#x20;

### Overview

What comes to mind when you think of the word game? How would you describe a game? Thinking about how people perceive games is helpful to game designers who seek to develop games people want to play.

#### **Direction**

1. &#x20;Think about the word "Game"
   1. &#x20;Create a list of words that help to define the word game"
   2. &#x20;Create a list of emotions that come to mind when you think about games
2. &#x20;Discuss and Reflect on your peer's answers
   1. &#x20;Were there any similarities?&#x20;
   2. &#x20;Did someone think of something you never thought about?&#x20;

&#x20;

## Definition of a Game

There are different ways in which to define the word game and here are just a few:

* An **activity** among two or more independent decision-makers seeking to achieve their **objectives** in some **limiting context**.
* A **form of art** in which participants, called players, make decisions to manage resources through game tokens in the pursuit of a **goal**.
* A **system** in which players engage in an artificial **conflict**, defined by **rules**, that results in a **quantifiable outcome**.
* A type of **play** (**activity**) that takes place in a pretend reality, in which the participants(s) follow a set of **rules** to achieve at least one **goal**.

Noticing any similarities? Games require a goal or objective, rules that limit what you can and cannot do, and finally an outcome resolving into a winner and loser.

### Play and Pretend

**Play** can easily be defined as taking part in an enjoyable activity for the sake of amusement. Simply playing around is not the same as playing a game unless the requirements for a game exist, which are goals, rules, and outcomes.

Another aspect of play is to pretend. To **pretend** is to create a fictional reality in the mind. A certain amount of buy-in by the participants i.e. players in this fictional reality is required to adhere to the rules of the game.

Take the game of soccer, for example, one of the main rules is that all players, save for the goalie, are not allowed to pick up the ball with their hands. In reality, anyone who is physically capable would be able to pick up the ball with their hands, but in this **fictional reality**, this act is forbidden.

This factional reality that players buy into the rules of the game, is called the **Magic Circle.** The term magic circle was first cited by Dutch historian Johan Huizinga, in his 1938 book Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-Element in Culture. This is one of the most noteworthy texts in-game psychology as it discusses the importance of play in culture and society.

**IMMERSIVE REALITIES**\
One way to ensure players buy into the fictional reality of the game is to further immersive them through storytelling and graphics. Therefore, video games can appear somewhat more addictive than physical games, because it is so easy to get caught up in the fictional world of the game.&#x20;

This activity is designed to help students identify puzzles and whether they qualify as a game.

### **Collaborative Learning Methods**

#### **Traditional Course**

Students are to complete the Masyu puzzle and then answer and the questions below. As a class, they will share and discuss their answers.

#### **Online Course**

Students are to complete the Masyu puzzle and then answer and the questions below. Students will share their answers in the online discussion forum.

### Overview

Puzzles are designed to make us think. The challenge is to solve the right answer. Puzzles are rule-based systems similar to games, there are also some key differences.

#### **Direction**

1. Complete the Masyu Puzzle Activity (See the puzzle key)
2. Once you have completed one or more of the puzzles answer the following questions:
   1. Was this fun?
   2. &#x20;Is there a goal?
   3. &#x20;Is there conflict?
   4. &#x20;Would (can) you play again?
   5. Would you call these puzzles a game? Why?          &#x20;

### Interactive Challenges

As we mentioned earlier playing does not always relate to playing a game. It depends on how we relate to the item we are playing with.

Game Designer and author of the 1982 book _Art of Computer Games_, Chris Crawford explored the idea that games are creative expressions and emphasized that interactivity is one of the main differences between games and other play activities.&#x20;

Jacob Habgood and Mark Overmars authors of _The Game Maker's Apprentice summarized_ Crawford's ideas by explaining that if there is interaction but no challenge, then it is just a toy. If there is a challenge but no interaction, then this is considered a puzzle. It is the combination of both interaction and challenge that distinguishes something as a game, and because of this, games can be referred to as **interactive challenges**.

### Why Do We Play Games?

{% hint style="info" %}
**GAMES THOUGHOUT HISTORY**\
Throughout the recorded history of the human species, we find evidence of both games and music. Interestingly enough, when taking part in both these activities we refer to it as playing a game or playing music.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Now that we have a better understanding of how to define a game, let us ask ourselves why do we play games?&#x20;

In the following video Michael Stevens educator and host of _Vsauce_, a YouTube channel focusing on science, psychology, mathematics, philosophy and related pop culture topics, shares some insight as to why do humans play games.

## Video Games

So far, we have been examining the word game as it applies to all games in general, but what about video games?

No one knows exactly where the term “video game” first originated from, however, it is speculated that it was probably introduced by the media and took off from there. Before this these games were referred to by their creators as electronic games, arcades, and computer games.

Today the term video game is synonymous with any game that is played on a “video” screen and requires some sort of input device.

### **Next-Generation of Gaming**

Video games as we know them have constantly evolved from early arcade machines to simple text-based computer games to the graphically rich games played on fully dedicated gaming systems that we enjoy today.

However, video games are currently going through another phase of evolution with the following types of games:&#x20;

*   **Augmented Reality** or simply **AR games** are a real-world view of one’s environment in which certain elements have been "augmented”. Players typically interact with these elements.


*   **Virtual Reality** or **VR games** are a three-dimensional environment in which the player can interact similarly to that of their environment, allowing for a fully immersive effect.


* **XR games** refer to any virtual reality, augmented reality, or combination of the two, often called mixed reality games. Think of the “X” in XR simply as a placeholder for any reality-manipulating game.

### Video Games in Daily Life

#### **Online Course**

Students will complete the activity survey. After submitting the activity student will review the correct answers and will further explore the data from the ESA annual report.

### Overview

The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) serves as the voice and advocate for the video game industry. The ESA’s mission is to expand and protect the dynamic worldwide marketplace for video games.

Each year the ESA complies with the _**Essential Facts About the Video Game Industry**_ report, which provides current statics about the game industry and game players.

#### **Direction**

Read each question carefully and then write your answer.

Earlier we said that history has shown that humans have always played games, and nothing seems to be changing that. According to the 2021 data complied in 2022 by the [**Entertainment Software Association (ESA)**](https://www.theesa.com/), the organization dedicated to serving the business and public affairs of the video game industry, **65%** of all American adults play video games and **69%** of all American households have at least one game in their home.

It also might surprise you to know that the average age of a gamer is **33** years old and that **48%** of all gamers are women. Furthermore, there are more adult women who play games than boys under 18. The increase in female gamers can somewhat be attributed to the rise of smartphones and the abundance of casual games available on that platform.

Now think about your gaming background. Would you consider yourself a gamer?
