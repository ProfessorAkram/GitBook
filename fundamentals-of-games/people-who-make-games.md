The process of making games is not as simple as one might think. It takes more than just a good idea. Games are made up of many elements that must work together as a whole and it is the role of the **game designer**, to strive towards that goal.

## The Game Designer

According to game designer and author Tracy Fullerton, the role of the **Game Designer** is to be an **advocate for the player**.

What exactly is an “advocate for the player”? The game designer needs to ensure that everything implemented in the game meets the needs and expectations of its intended players. Sounds easy enough, right?

The problem that game designers sometimes face, is that they are not part of the target market for which the game they are designing is intended. For example, maybe you have come up with a game aimed at 2nd graders to help teach them math. Chances are there are not many 2nd graders on your game production team needing help with math, though that math one may be debatable.

The point here is that game designers need to ensure that the game will be fun to play for their target market and that no unnecessary elements are added to the game that will alienate, confuse, frustrate, or bore their players.

**Thing Like a Game Designer**

Everyone working on a game production team should **think like a game designer** when it comes to being an **advocate for the player**.

## Game Production Team

In the early days of the video game industry, many games were made by a single individual. Today, however, games are just as large as an endeavor as making a feature film and require a team of dedicated individuals each with specific roles.

### **Game Designer**

While everyone on the game production team should think like a **game designer**, the actual title of the game designer is usually reserved for one or two individuals who are responsible for conceiving the main idea of the game.

Game designer’s tasks include:

* &#x20;Brainstorm and refining game ideas
* Creating game prototypes
* &#x20;Preparing all documentation on the project and updates
* Making decisions on the direction of the game
* Playtesting and revising each iteration of the game
* Creating game levels or working closely with level designers
* Communicates the vision of the game and ensures the entire team works towards

#### Game Designer vs Game Developer

The terms **game designer** and **game developer** are often misinterpreted. More often than not in academia, a **game design** courses typically focus on art and narrative while **game development** courses are reserved for programming courses.&#x20;

However, this is not an accurate analysis of the terms or the roles in the industry. Instead the term **Game design** should be reserved to define the sum of the whole, meaning all the elements in a game system working together to produce enjoyable **gameplay**. A game designer has to be able to see the big picture and how the game will come together.

On the other hand a anyone working on the game production is apart of **game development**. Thing of game development as the process of creating something, artist develop artwork, programmers develop code, audio engineers develop sound clips; they are all game developers.&#x20;

Furthermore author and game designer Richard Lemarchand, proposes the, the game the idea that "Every game developer is a game designer". The conclusion that Lemarchand makes, is that through the development process the individual developers will need to make choices that will ultimately impact the game design. Lemarchand goes on to note that individuals with "Game Designer" in their job title should be aware of this facet of game production while also ensuring that the best game design decisions are implmented into the final product.&#x20;

Common misconceptions about what a game designer is
{% endembed %}

### **Game Director**

Some of the tasks originally assigned to the game designer have recently been given to the more recent role of the game **director**. You might have heard of the title of production manager or producer and the game director takes on all the same responsibilities, however, they are often far more involved in the development process than the traditional producer would be.

The main task of the game director is to **keep the flow of communication** within the development team, ensure that everyone is **working towards the main vision** of the game, and **know the production** in terms of deadlines and budget.

&#x20;Game directors will often have previous experience as a game designer and will take their experience with them as they work with a new team in the development of the next big project.

### **Level Designer**

A **level designer** as the title implies is responsible for creating the level. This entails everything from the goals of the level, the challenges the player faces in the level, the size and length of the level, and the behavior of the resources in the level.

Often the game designer takes on the role of lead level designer or sole level designer in smaller productions.

### **Game Programmer**

The **game programmer** is responsible for implementing all the technical aspects of the game. In many cases, you might have a designated programmer for, say, the weapons system while another one might be focusing on character controls and behaviors.

While the tasks might be different among programmers, they all should work together ensuring each system is compatible with the others and **adhere to a set standard** when it comes to documenting their code.

### **Visual Artists**

All the visuals in the game, from characters, world objects menu graphics, cut scenes, and cinematics all fall under the responsibility of the **visual artist**.

There are many titles for this specific role, anything from environmental artist, character designer, animator, 3d modeler, and graphic artist, just to name a few. Regardless of their official title or how many are on a specific development team, they all need to work together to ensure a **consistent style throughout the game.**

### **UX Designers**

Early video game developers gave little thought to the overall user experience i.e., UX. Granted there was little to think about, after all, you had a start screen and maybe a few dialog boxes to read through.

However, in today’s immersive and vast game worlds, players must keep track, of inventories, quests, weapons, health and so much more. Having a system in place that is both simple and intuitive to use can make or break a game.

Thus, comes the role of the **UX designer**, they are responsible for ensuring a smooth user experience for the player. This means they need to identify the best placement, order, and functionality for all elements that the player must interact with. There is a lot of player psychology and playtesting that goes into good UX design.

Furthermore, UX designers are not to be confused with user interface or **UI designers**. UI designers simply design the graphics used in the interface of the game, the menu buttons health bars, etc. Often UI design is either assigned as a task to visual artists or one of the responsibilities of the UX designer.&#x20;

### **Quality Assurance Engineers**

When you were younger did you dream of getting a job as a game tester? Awe, the life to be paid to play games.

The stereotype of the 20-something making money playing games is far from reality. Typically, if there is a beta test call for a game, the game has been tested long before it ever gets to that stage.

**Quality Assurance Engineers** or **QA Engineers** are more than just game players, they not only play the games they try and break them, documenting every detail as to what the player actions are, what the game is doing, any bugs they might encounter, and possible causes for the issue. QA engineers need to have a basic understanding of the game mechanics to diagnose any problems.

Some companies solely focus on QA for game production and work with game studios for testing throughout the game production.

Regardless of whether there is a dedicated QA engineer on the team or not, all members of the game production team should be testing the game throughout the production process.

### **Specialized Media**

Game production can be a massive undertaking and depending on the size of the game it may require an even larger team to develop.

Depending on the type of game you are making you might also require:

* Writers to create rich narratives, scripts, and or quests
* Audio / Video Specialist to create custom soundtracks, record voice-overs, film cuteness, or motion capture.
* Field masters to share detailed information about a subject. For example, if you are making a cooking game and know nothing about cooking you might bring in a chef to share their knowledge.

## Game Design Portfolio

The game industry is a highly competitive field that requires candidates to be able to showcase their work and passion for the industry. The best method of doing this is to have an online portfolio. Portfolios help to showcase the type, quality and level of work you have done and are capable of producing.&#x20;

### Portfolio Platforms

Creating a portfolio nowadays is pretty easy if you use the right platform and tools. The platform you choose really depends on the type of work you are highlighting and role you are seeking in the industry. It is also not uncommon for professionals to have more than one portfolio, each showcasing a different skillsets.&#x20;

[**ArtStation**](https://www.artstation.com)

ArtStation is an online portfolio site and community for artists in games, film, media & entertainment arts. Whether your goal is to be a 3D character modeler, 2D storyboarded, or visual effects guru, ArtStation is the ideal platform for your portfolio.

[**GitHub**](https://github.com/)

is cited as being an online software development platform, that offers collaboration and version control. However, GitHub is a great portfolio platform for programmers that what to show off their development skills.&#x20;

[**Itch.io** ](https://itch.io/)

Itch provides independent game designers with a platform for hosting, selling, and downloading their games. Itch is the perfect platform for game designers who want to show off an entire game from start to finish.&#x20;

**Blogging Portfolio**

While a portfolio of one's work, is in such a competitive field, employers are seeking individuals who not only can get the work done but will go the extra mile because they are invested in the project or industry.

One way to highlight your passion and drive is to maintain a portfolio blog. This online website will not only be a place to post links to your work, but also short blog posts sharing your thoughts and opinions on techniques, trends, and personal workflow.\


There are many free blogging platforms available and one of the most popular ones is Wordpress.com.&#x20;
